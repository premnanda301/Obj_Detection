# Object Detection Model Training

This repository contains scripts and steps to train an object detection model using custom images, videos, and Label Studio for annotation. Follow the instructions below to set up your environment, collect data, and train the model.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed on your system. You will also need the following:
- Virtual environment (for isolation of dependencies)
- Label Studio (for labeling the data)
- Required Python libraries (as mentioned in `requirements.txt`)

## Steps to Set Up and Train the Model

### Step 1: Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

First, create and activate a virtual environment to isolate the dependencies.

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Step 2: Install All Dependencies

Install the required dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Use Image and Video Collection

Once the environment is set up, use the provided Python scripts (e.g., `collect_images.py`, `collect_videos.py`) to collect the images and videos for training. Make sure to place the collected data in the appropriate directories as indicated in the scripts.

### Step 4: Use Label Studio for Data Annotation

Use [Label Studio](https://labelstud.io/) to annotate your images. This tool helps in creating bounding boxes and labels for your dataset. After labeling, export the annotations in the format supported by your model.

- To install Label Studio:

```bash
pip install label-studio
```

- To start Label Studio:

```bash
label-studio
```

- Follow the on-screen instructions to label the dataset.
- After annotating the images make sure to extract the zip file as YOLO format only .
- The dataset I have provided is annotated you can use it to check the model too . 

### Step 5: Run `create_data_yaml.py`

Use the `create_data_yaml.py` script to generate a `data.yaml` file. This file will specify the paths to the training and validation datasets, along with the number of classes and their names.

```bash
python create_data_yaml.py
```

### Step 6: Modify `data.yaml` File

Open the generated `data.yaml` file and make any necessary modifications. For example:
- Update the paths to your dataset if needed.
- Update the path of the data.yaml file to your absolute path
- For example mine absolute path is - C:/Users/nanda/Desktop/Object Detection Model/dataset
- Use yours in the above example . 
- Modify the number of classes and their names according to your dataset.

### Step 7: Train the Model

Once the `data.yaml` file is properly configured, you can start training the model. Make sure your model configuration file (e.g., `yolov5.yaml`) is ready.

Run the training script:

```bash
python train.py 
```

Adjust the number of epochs and other parameters as required for your project.

### Step 8: Use `test_final.py` to Test the Model

After training is complete, use the `test_final.py` script to test the performance of the model on your dataset.

```bash
python test_final.py
```

This will run the model on the test dataset and display the performance metrics.

## Additional Notes

- Ensure you have sufficient GPU resources for model training, as training can be computationally expensive.
- The training dataset should be properly labeled and split into training and validation sets to achieve good results.

This `README.md` file provides a clear and organized guide for setting up the project and training the model. Let me know if you need further customization or clarification!
